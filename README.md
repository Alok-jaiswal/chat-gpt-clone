# Chat GPT Clone

This project is a clone of the Chat GPT application, created using React.js. It allows users to engage in text-based conversations with a GPT-3.5-powered AI model, just like the one you are interacting with right now. Whether you want to have a casual chat, seek information, or experiment with AI-powered text generation, this application provides an interactive platform for such interactions.

## Usage

1. Once you have the application running, you can start chatting with the AI model by typing messages in the input field at the bottom of the chat interface.

2. Press "Enter" or click the "Send" button to send your message to the AI model.

3. The AI model will respond with its generated text, which will appear in the chat interface as AI messages.

4. You can continue the conversation by sending additional messages to the AI model.

5. Experiment with different prompts and questions to see how the AI model responds.
